    "# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition \n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modeling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement, \n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleavland database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of the data set available on kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> if we can reach 95% accuracy at prediction whether or not a patient has heart disease during th proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you will get different information about each of the features in your data.\n",

    "    - Value 3: asymptomatic\n",
    "4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "    - Value 0: normal\n",
    "    - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n",
    "    - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by estes' criteria\n",
    "8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "    - Value 0: upsloping\n",
